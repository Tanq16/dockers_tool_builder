# Security Docker Tool Builder

This repo builds a tool docker once a month for all golang executables to be used for the Security Docker container at the [CST](https://github.com/tanq16/containerized-security-toolkit) repo. The docker is used as a multi-stage build for the security docker, where executables are copied from this docker to the security docker.
